# Demo WebSocket

WebSockets are fun!  This repo contains a websockets enabled  demo Express Server with a built-in jquery websockets chat app as well as a demo React websockets chat app 

Run each as a separate node project with:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Try running both client apps at the same time in different browser windows to watch what happens.

Browse to http://localhost:8080 for the built-in jQuery App

The React App does an auto-connect when it renders.  The jQuery App hse a manual connect.  Both methods are used in apps so it really depends on your particular design.
