# Latch
Latch is an app that allows users to quickly and easily find language exchange partners to practice learning the language or languages of their choice. For users who may want to learn on their own, we have a learning bot that allows users to ask how to say things in different languages and quickly receive answers in the app. Latch was built on PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node, and also uses Socket.io for websockets as well as two APIs for translations and the learning bot.
